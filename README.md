# Sagres Airport – Movement Area Design  

This repository contains two PDF documents presenting the preliminary design of the movement area for a proposed airport in Sagres, Portugal. The work was carried out as part of a university project in the field of airport planning and design.  

## Project Description  
A developer considered the possibility of building a new aerodrome in Sagres (Portugal). The facility was intended to operate with **Boeing 737-NG** aircraft as the critical type, with a runway designed for **Category I precision approaches in one direction** and **non-precision approaches in the opposite direction**.  

The assignment consisted of drafting a **basic preliminary design** (descriptive report and drawings) that included:  
- Calculation of **declared distances** in each runway direction.  
- Definition of **runway strips, obstacle-free zones, and stopways** as required.  
- Design of **taxiways** connecting the runway to other facilities.  
- A parking apron with capacity for **15 aircraft of different types**, including at least **5 stands suitable for the critical aircraft**.  

## Contents  
- **Movement Area Layout** – Scaled drawings of the runway, taxiways, apron, and clearances.  
- **Supporting Documentation** – Justification of the chosen geometric parameters, design decisions, and compliance with ICAO/EASA standards.  

## Learning Objectives  
This project allowed us to:  
- Apply international regulations (ICAO Annex 14 and EASA standards) to a real-world case.  
- Develop skills in **airport master planning** and **airside design**.  
- Understand how to dimension movement areas to ensure **safety, efficiency, and operational flexibility**.  

## Purpose  
The repository is shared as an academic reference for students and professionals interested in airport planning and design, especially in the layout and dimensioning of aerodrome movement areas.
